        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>It's hot chocolate. You know what it is. It's vegan because it uses a plant-based milk as opposed
            to cow's milk. There are also no marshmallows, because those are made of gelatin and wouldn't be vegan.
            My personal humble favourite plant-based milk is oat milk. There are many reasons I think oat milk is 
            great, but the number one is sustainability. Oats are a great cover crop and can be grown in many places 
            without exorbitant amounts of water. The same cannot be said of alternatives like monocrops of almonds. 
            Enough preaching! Let's get to hot chocolate.</p>
        <p>P.S. The chocolate in this recipe is just... chocolate. Yes, not cocoa. So decadent.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>Yield: 2</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 bar of semi-sweet dark chocolate</li>
            <li>4 cups plant-based milk of choice</li>
            <li>Optional: toppings such as cocoa, cinnamon, or cononut whipped cream</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt the chocolate by double-boiling it.</li>
            <li>Heat the plant-based milk in a small saucepan, stirring constantly; bring to a simmer.</li>
            <li>Add the chocolate to the saucepan with the plant-based milk.</li>
            <li>Continue to stir over low-medium heat. The chocolate and water will separate, so it's important to stir continuously and as fast as possible.
                This would be a great time to use a whisk, if you have one. 
            </li>
            <li>Pour hot chocolate into mugs, add optional toppings and serve.</li>
        </ol>
