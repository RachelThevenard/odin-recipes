        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Thanks to the Instant Pot, this is really just too easy to make. 
        I'm sure there are other brands of pressure cookers that do similar things.
        This recipe is inspired by Michelle's Kitchen Creations, a Nova Scotia business that
        was run by a woman who seems to have moved on to subsequent endeavors. She 
        created these ready-to-cook soups in a jar that were deliciously hearty. Because she is no longer in 
        business, I have had to try to figure all the ingredient ratios out on my own. My recommendation 
        to you is, thus, to also try to figure it out on your own, using this recipe only as a guide. You may be better at this than me.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup red lentils</li>
            <li>1 cup green lentils</li>

            <li>1/2 tsp salt, plus more to taste</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>

            <li>Mince the garlic.</li>
            <li>Saute the onion and garlic in the cooking oil in the Instant Pot until onions are soft.</li>
